	<li>Sample size re-estimation using Bayesian posterior predictive probability - a 30% reduction in trial length</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rescue Mission for an NDA Submission</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>NDA re-prepared with amended phase 3 CSRs, new ISS, new statistics data package compliant to the FDA eSubmission requirement - all completed in 2Â½ months</li>

	<li>Mid-course modification of a group sequential trial from the O'Brien-Flembing "spending function" to an ad hoc Lan-DeMets spending function</li>
	<li>Non-inferiority study design for a cardiovascular drug with MACE endpoint - a sample size challenge</li>
</ul>
